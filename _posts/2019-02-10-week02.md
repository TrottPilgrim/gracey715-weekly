### Contributions
As it turns out, I've basically become the only person in my team, meaning all contributions to the extension we've been working on have been done by me. To be more specific, I:
* Came up with the extension idea
* Had to learn how to even make an extension
* Wrote the README
* Wrote the manifest
* Threw together some HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make something that actually works.
